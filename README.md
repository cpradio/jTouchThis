# jTouchThis
A pure JavaScript library that turns any screen into a touch screen. From that old CRT sitting in your basement, 
to the new LED sitting on your desk, this will enable you to use touch to make your pages more interactive!

But why stop at computer monitors? This library can be used to enhance your television too!

And let's not let the Automobile industry fall behind, this can transform that horrible Dashboard to a 
wonderful digital H.U.D. (Heads-Up Display).

## Dependencies?
That's what makes this even better! There are zero script dependencies! It is all native JavaScript!

## Installation
Simply copy the files in /src/ into a folder on your site and reference it using 
`<script src="/src/jTouchThis.min.js>` at the bottom of your page near the `</body>` tag.

## To Do
- Add templates for the H.U.D. capabilities to help improve customization.
- Add translations for light tap tooltips
- Remind everyone this is an April Fool's Joke
